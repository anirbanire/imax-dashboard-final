    <!-- Business Question -->
    <h2>Business question</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <p style="font-size:13px; margin:0;">
        How has IMAX’s stock and financial performance recovered after the COVID‑19 shock compared with cinema peers
        AMC and Cinemark (CNK), and what strategic actions should IMAX prioritise to strengthen its post‑COVID market
        position?
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Key Insights -->
    <h2>Key insights</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <ul class="notes">
        <li>IMAX’s quarterly average share price has recovered from mid‑teens in 2020 to the low‑20s by 2025, while AMC remains stuck below pre‑COVID levels despite meme‑stock spikes.</li>
        <li>Indexed performance (Jan 2020 = 100) shows IMAX and CNK gradually moving back toward their pre‑COVID baseline, whereas AMC stabilises at roughly one‑third of its original index value.</li>
        <li>IMAX revenue has almost tripled since 2020 and net income has turned positive from 2022 onward, supporting the stronger equity recovery relative to highly leveraged peers.</li>
        <li>IMAX box office has grown faster than the wider global box office, indicating that premium formats and blockbuster releases are key drivers of its recovery.</li>
        <li>If IMAX sustains low double‑digit revenue growth and current margins in 2025F and beyond, the stock is well positioned to move further toward pre‑COVID index levels, supporting a strategy focused on scaling high‑margin premium screens.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- IMAX PRICE ONLY -->
    <h2 id="imax">IMAX Share Price (Quarterly average, 2020–2025)</h2>
    <p style="font-size:12px; margin:0 0 5px 0;">Quarterly average closing price for IMAX (USD), summarising daily stock data from 2020–2025.</p>
    <div id="imax_chart" class="chart"></div>
    <ul class="notes">
      <li>IMAX’s quarterly average price shows a sharp COVID‑19 drop in 2020 followed by a steady recovery through 2023–2025.</li>
      <li>The quarterly view smooths daily volatility and highlights the underlying trend in investor confidence in IMAX.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- PRICE LEVELS -->
    <h2 id="price">IMAX vs CNK vs AMC Share Prices (Quarterly average)</h2>
    <p style="font-size:12px; margin:0 0 5px 0;">Quarterly average share prices (USD) for IMAX, CNK and AMC based on their respective daily closes.</p>
    <div id="price_chart" class="chart"></div>
    <ul class="notes">
      <li>IMAX and CNK prices recover more steadily after 2020, while AMC remains highly volatile and ends the period at much lower average levels.</li>
      <li>The comparative view emphasises IMAX’s relatively defensive profile versus AMC’s speculative trading behaviour.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- INDEXED RECOVERY -->
    <h2 id="index">Post‑COVID Stock Recovery (Quarterly index, Jan 2020 = 100)</h2>
    <p style="font-size:12px; margin:0 0 5px 0;">Quarterly averages of each company’s price index, where early‑2020 values are normalised to 100.</p>
    <div id="index_chart" class="chart"></div>
    <ul class="notes">
      <li>All three indices fall below 100 in 2020, but IMAX and CNK move closer back to baseline over time than AMC.</li>
      <li>AMC’s index remains structurally weaker despite meme‑stock rallies, while IMAX’s index improves as fundamentals recover.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- FINANCIALS -->
    <h2 id="fin">IMAX Revenue and Net Income (2020–2025F)</h2>
    <p style="font-size:12px; margin:0 0 5px 0;">
      Annual IMAX revenue and net income (USD millions), including a simple 2025 forecast (2025F) based on company guidance and recent growth trends rather than actual reported results.
    </p>
    <div id="fin_chart" class="chart"></div>
    <ul class="notes">
      <li>Revenue nearly doubles from 2020 to 2021 and continues to grow through 2023, with a modest dip in 2024 and a forecasted step‑up again in 2025F.</li>
      <li>The positive 2025F outlook, combined with improving margins, supports a prescriptive strategy of reinvesting in high‑margin premium screens and technology upgrades.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- BOX OFFICE -->
    <h2 id="box">Global vs IMAX Box Office (USD billions)</h2>
    <p style="font-size:12px; margin:0 0 5px 0;">Annual global box office versus IMAX box office (USD billions), including simple 2025 forecasts.</p>
    <div id="box_chart" class="chart"></div>
    <ul class="notes">
      <li>Global box office moves back toward pre‑COVID levels, although recovery is not perfectly linear across years.</li>
      <li>IMAX box office grows faster in relative terms, suggesting that prioritising blockbuster partnerships and premium experiences is critical to sustaining growth.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- LIMITATIONS & NEXT STEPS -->
    <h2 id="limits">Limitations and next steps</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <ul class="notes">
        <li>The analysis focuses on headline stock prices, simple quarterly averages and high‑level financials, without segmenting by region, screen count or individual film performance.</li>
        <li>Forecasts are deliberately simple and trend‑based and do not incorporate full macroeconomic or competitive scenario modelling.</li>
        <li>Future work could compare IMAX with streaming competitors, add cash‑flow and leverage metrics, and use richer forecasting or scenario analysis to stress‑test IMAX’s recovery under different box‑office and cost assumptions.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- DOCUMENTATION & AI USAGE -->
    <h2 id="docs">Data, methods and AI usage</h2>
    <div class="box">
      <h3 style="margin-top:0;">Data and preparation</h3>
      <ul class="notes">
        <li>Daily share prices for IMAX, CNK and AMC were collected from public market data and aggregated into quarterly averages to reduce noise and emphasise long‑term trends.</li>
        <li>IMAX financial metrics and global versus IMAX box office figures were taken from publicly available company reports and industry summaries, then manually structured into CSV files before being embedded as JavaScript arrays.</li>
        <li>Stock indices were created by normalising early‑2020 prices to 100 and averaging these index values at a quarterly level to compare relative recovery paths.</li>
        <li>All datasets are publicly available, contain no personal or GDPR‑sensitive information, and are used solely for educational, non‑commercial analysis in line with the module’s academic integrity guidelines.</li>
        <li>Data sources are cited in the accompanying assignment documentation, and figures are used as‑is without attempting to reverse‑engineer or replicate any proprietary models.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Use of AI tools</h3>
      <p style="font-size:13px;">
        AI tools were used to help design the overall dashboard layout, generate and debug JavaScript and Plotly code, and convert raw CSV data into embedded JavaScript arrays.  
        The quarterly resampling logic and Git/GitHub workflow were refined with AI assistance, while data sourcing, business framing, chart selection and final storytelling were carried out independently.  
        All AI‑generated suggestions were checked against the underlying data, and the code was iteratively adapted to match the specific IMAX use case and the technical constraints of the assignment brief.
